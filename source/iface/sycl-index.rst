Interface
=========

For further details on SYCL, see the `SYCL
Specification <https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/specs/sycl-1.2.1.pdf>`__.

.. tip::
   
   If you are unfamiliar with C++ templates and lambda functions,
   consult a C++ language references to gain a basic understanding
   before continuing.

Header File
===========

A single header file must be included::

``sycl`` namespace. ``buffer`` is ``sycl::buffer``, and
``info::device::name`` is ``sycl::info::device::name``.
