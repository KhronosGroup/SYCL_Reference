SYCL Reference
==============

Welcome to the SYCL Reference! This document is intended to be a handy
reference for:

* looking SYCL classes member functions, their arguments
* sharing links to SYCL functions/types with other developers
* finding usage examples

The reference supplements the |SYCL_SPEC| and has the same overall
structure.

The document is a work-in-progress, and we are publishing now with
the hope that the community will make it better. We want to have a
document that is up-to-date and accurate, with many usage examples. If
you see something wrong, something that could be better, or want to
contribute examples or descriptions, feel free to use the buttons at
the top right to file an issue on GitHub or suggest an edit.
